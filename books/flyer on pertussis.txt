Pertussis (also known as whooping cough or 100-day cough) is a highly contagious bacterial disease.

The classic symptoms of pertussis are a paroxysmal cough, inspiratory whoop, and fainting, or vomiting after coughing.

The antibiotics erythromycin, clarithromycin, or azithromycin are typically the recommended treatment.
