Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne tropical disease caused by the dengue virus.

Symptoms typically begin three to fourteen days after infection. This may include a high fever, headache, vomiting, muscle and joint pains, and a characteristic skin rash.

No known cure is available, but an antiserum is being tested.
