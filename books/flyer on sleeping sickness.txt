African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, is an insect-borne parasitic disease of humans and other animals. 

Initially, in the first stage of the disease, there are fevers, headaches, itchiness, and joint pains. This begins one to three weeks after the bite. Weeks to months later the second stage begins with confusion, poor coordination, numbness and trouble sleeping. Diagnosis is via finding the parasite in a blood smear or in the fluid of a lymph node. A lumbar puncture is often needed to tell the difference between first and second stage disease.

The current treatment for first-stage disease is intravenous or intramuscular pentamidine for T. b. gambiense

For the second stage of T. b. gambiense the combination of nifurtimox and eflornithine (NECT) or eflornithine alone appear to be more effective and result in fewer side effects.
